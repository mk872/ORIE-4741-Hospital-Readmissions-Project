# ORIE-4741-Hospital-Readmissions-Project
National health care expenditures are expected to be $3.4 trillion for 2016 with avoidable hospital readmissions expected to be $17 billion. In an attempt to lessen such costs while also improving hospital quality, several researchers have developed statistical models for objectively evaluating patient conditions. However, it is important to note that in the context of hospital readmission, most of these models exhibit poor predictive performance and are unsuitable for use in a clinical setting. To address this issue, we plan to develop a hospital readmission prediction model that has improved probabilistic calibration, discrimination, and accuracy in determining whether a patient with a given set of conditions will be re-admitted. Recent advances in scalability for model development and assessment, as well as our prior experiences working with large data sets, give us  confidence that we can ultimately develop a model with better predictive performance than those currently available.
