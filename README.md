# Project Description:
 
National health care expenditures are expected to be $3.4 trillion for 2016 with avoidable hospital readmissions expected to be $17 billion. In an attempt to lessen such costs while also improving hospital quality, several researchers have developed statistical models for objectively evaluating patient conditions. However, it is important to note that in the context of hospital readmission, most of these models exhibit poor predictive performance and are unsuitable for use in a clinical setting. To address this issue, we plan to develop a hospital readmission prediction model that has improved predictive performance in determining whether a patient with a given set of conditions will be re-admitted, while also ensuring that it is practical in a clinical setting.
